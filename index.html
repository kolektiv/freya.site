    <h1>Functional</h1>
    <p>Freya embraces the power of F# and a functional approach to web programming, allowing it to fit seamlessly with your existing functional code. Of course, it can happily work with OO code if you have some!</p>

    <h1>Stack</h1>
    <p>Freya is a stack not a framework. You can choose which parts of Freya you wish to use &mdash; or use everything (just pick the <a href="">Freya</a> meta package from NuGet). It's easy to extend and specialise Freya to be the perfect stack for you.</p>
